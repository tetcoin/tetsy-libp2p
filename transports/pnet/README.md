## tetsy-libp2p-pnet

The `pnet` protocol implements *Pre-shared Key Based Private Networks in tetsy-libp2p*,
as specified in [the spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pnet/Private-Networks-PSK-V1.md)

Tetsy-Libp2p nodes configured with a pre-shared key can only communicate with other nodes with
the same key.
