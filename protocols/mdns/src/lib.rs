//! mDNS is a protocol defined by [RFC 6762](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) that allows
//! querying nodes that correspond to a certain domain name.
//!
//! In the context of tetsy-libp2p, the mDNS protocol is used to discover other nodes on the local
//! network that support tetsy-libp2p.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate provides the `Mdns` struct which implements the `NetworkBehaviour` trait. This
//! struct will automatically discover other tetsy-libp2p nodes on the local network.
//!

/// The DNS service name for all tetsy-libp2p peers used to query for addresses.
const SERVICE_NAME: &[u8] = b"_p2p._udp.local";
/// The meta query for looking up the `SERVICE_NAME`.
const META_QUERY_SERVICE: &[u8] = b"_services._dns-sd._udp.local";
